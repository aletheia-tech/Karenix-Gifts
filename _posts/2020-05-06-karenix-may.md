      <h1 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-2 text-gray-800">{{ page.title }}</h1>

      <p class="text-gray-800">In these very uncertain times, we must all remember that we are surrounded by love,
      hope and change. Every day that we are blessed to be able to wake up and seize another day to
      learn, grow and progress. As the world changes, we must all adapt and progress with the ever
      changing world.

      During these times, while the Coronovirus has taken over the world, we at Karenix, are
      still here for you. We are able to help you find your perfect gift for those who you love. We
      understand that during the times it is difficult, but we are still in operation, and are still able to
      help you find what you need.</p>
