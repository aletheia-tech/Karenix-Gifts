        This educational, personalized book is also a great fundraising tool!

      <br><br>
      The star of the story spends a day at a big league baseball park with Homer, the mascot for the Home Run Against
      Drugs school program, as he mentors him or her about making wise decisions (donâ€™t smoke, drink alcoholic beverages
      or take drugs) and healthy choices in life (eat right, exercise, stay in school).
      <br><br>
      Your child will value the Strike Force lessons and tips from professional baseball players on every page.
