        Is there a little ballerina princess in your life?
      </strong>
      <br><br>
      This personalized story details the weeks leading up to the final ballet recital and how your child and her
      friends prepare for the big event by practicing all the ballet movements they learned in dance class. At the last
      moment, the famous ballerina who was starring in the show becomes sick.
      Your little girl is chosen to replace the leading role and gives a star performance! As the flowers are brought to
      the stage, your child realizes all of her hard work and practice paid off.
      Ballerina steps and positions are illustrated on the last two pages for the beginning ballerina and her family.
