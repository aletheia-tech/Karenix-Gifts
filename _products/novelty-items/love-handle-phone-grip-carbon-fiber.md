      The LoveHandle Universal Phone Grip (original SlingGrip) is a smartphone and mini tablet grip attachment that adheres to the device using a strong but removable no-residue 3M peel-n- stick adhesive. Featuring a patented slim-profile pocket-friendly design that won't get in the way, the LoveHandle enables users to securely hold their devices without the risk of dropping them. 
      <br><br>
      The LoveHandle is great for taking crisp photos (particularly selfies!) and steady videos, and makes one-handed phone use much easier. It also allows you to flip your phone around to the back of your hand, allowing you to carry additional items while keeping track of your phone. In addition, using a LoveHandle to help you hold on to your phone can be quite helpful when jogging, biking, and at just about any other time you don't want to drop your phone. Our customers tell us that the LoveHandle becomes an indispensable part of their device within the first 30 minutes of using it. 
      <br><br>
      Why don't you give the LoveHandle a try for yourself! COMPATIBILITY NOTES: Cases: The LoveHandle is not compatible with silicone cases such as the Apple Silicone Case or gel cases. TPU cases should work well. Please contact us if you're not sure if your case is compatible. Phones: If you have an Apple iPhone 8, iPhone 7 or Apple iPhone 7 Plus that is Black (often referred to as Matte Black) or Jet Black, the LoveHandle should be used with a compatible case to ensure optimal adhesion. 
      <br><br>
      The LoveHandle is not compatible with glass back phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S6 or soft back phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and Motorola Droid Turbo 2. We suggest using the LoveHandle on a compatible case for your phone.
